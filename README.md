I plan to construct a Coding Club (CC) Style tutorial that introduces the statistics and probability background for the typical analyses we do using R.  I came up with this idea as I was working through many of the CC tutorials and found myself constantly asking "why does this work?", or "what does is the F-statistics?", "I know what the p-value represent but how is it calculated?".  Since we are encouraged to make a tutorial based on the questions and uncertainty we get as we progress through the course, I decide to try and find answer to some of these uncertainties in hope to provide a solid background that help future CC members get started with statistical programming more "smoothly".

Statistics is an entire subject in itself and there is a breath of topics within statistics.  It's fundamentals are heavily rooted in mathematics and probability and to fully explain many of the concepts would require integral calculus and other theoretical knowledge that is outside the scope of CC.  However, there are certain basics within statistis that I think deserves clarifications.  Below are some of the topics I think about covering.


## Topics to discuss

### Describing data distributions

Knowing what mean, median, mode, standard deviation and IQR is fundamental for statistics as they describe the central tendency and variance of our observed data.  However, it is important to see how these terms relate to one and another especially in relation to the shape of the distributions.  

### Populations, sample, and sample statistics

Most of the data we collect are just a small subset (**samples**) of information taken from the world around us (**population**).  Using summary statistics and statistical analysis, we are trying to capture the **population** values through our **samples**.  I will try to illustrate the idea of sample size, the central limit theorem, and sample vs. sampling distribution.  This will provide background for making statistical inference in the future sections.

### Sample size, marginal of error and confidence interval

### Significance

### t-distribution and comparison of 2 means

### Wrap-up and bringing everything back to Coding Club 

After demonstrating the fundamental statistics, I hope to tie all this knowledge and relate it back to some of the most basic functions we learn in R.  That is the ANOVA.
